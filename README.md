What we are gonna do?

The random function generates the number between 1 to 100
The user has 10 chances to guess the number. So, we ask max 10 times to user to enter a number. Once the user guess is matched with an actual number then the game is over.
If the user canâ€™t guess the number then the game is over. S

Python concepts are covered in this project are
If-else,
While Loop,
Random function,
break statement.
